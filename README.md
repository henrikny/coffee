Shiny Coffee app


Tired of co-workes complaining about how "no one" makes a pot of coffee?
Fire up a shiny-server with this bitchin' app, slap up a tablet next the coffee maker and voil√† - the barista-of-the-week game is on!



My current department is called "FRIEND", so feel free to change this to your own :)

Make sure to have all packages installed prior to runnign the app.

Set up initial db by running some of the lines in coffee_db.R.

To aviod sharing my own data, I set a path to a external db (separate file in parrallel folder coffe-db) in global.R
