Shiny Coffee app


Tired of co-workes complaining about how "no one" makes a pot of coffee?
Fire up a shiny-server with this bitchin' app, slap up a tablet next the coffee maker and voil√† - the barista-of-the-week game is on!




TO DOS:

"Barista of the week" now gets the whole table, should only get last weeks data.
Problem: Dates are stored as text.

Can not select same person two times. Work-around: Select different person, and then re-select the relevant name.
