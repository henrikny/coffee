# coffee
Shiny Coffee app


## Intro

Tired of co-worked complaining about how "no one" makes a pot of coffee?
Fire up a shiny-server with this bitchin' app, slap up a tablet next the coffee maker and voil√† - the barista-of-the-week game is on!

- You need a server (obsolete laptop workes just fine) with ubuntu + shiny-server installed.
- A table (Galaxy tab/iPad) on same WiFi network.



## Initialisation

Check out offee_db.R for more info regarding initialisation.

```{r}
## load libraries
library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)
library(dbplyr)
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)

## set path
getwd()
# setwd("/srv/shiny-server/coffee")
# db_path <- "../coffee-db/coffee.sqlite"

## connect to existing / create empty database
coffee_db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), db_path)

## add tables
sql <- sqlCreateTable(con = coffee_db, 
                      table = "persons", 
                      fields = c(name = "TEXT", 
                                 active = "SMALLINT"), 
                      row.names = FALSE)
dbExecute(conn = coffee_db, 
          statement = sql, 
          overwrite = TRUE)
sql <- sqlCreateTable(con = coffee_db, 
                      table = "actions", 
                      fields = c(time = "REAL",
                                 name_id = "TEXT", 
                                 active = "SMALLINT", 
                                 action = "TEXT",
                                 backfilled = "SMALLINT"), 
                      row.names = FALSE)
dbExecute(conn = coffee_db, 
          statement = sql, 
          overwrite = TRUE)

## list tables
dbListTables(coffee_db)

## disconnect
dbDisconnect(coffee_db)
```



## Notes

- My current department is called "FRIEND", so feel free to change this to your own :)

- Make sure to have all packages installed prior to running the app.

- To avoid sharing my own data, I set a path to a external db (separate file in parallel folder coffee-db) in global.R
